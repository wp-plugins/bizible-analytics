== Description ==
Bizible Marketing Analytics connects sales and marketing data together inside Salesforce so you can optimize your online marketing campaigns by ROI. Tying your marketing efforts to actual closed deals is essential to making profitable marketing decisions and accelerating business growth.

This Wordpress plugin inserts an invisible web analytics script (Similar to Google Analytics) on each page of your website. This script tracks each visitor on your site and logs their behavior so you can easily track where your leads are coming from and see what pages they viewed on your site before converting.
